# Architecture Decision Records — Service Extraction Template and Worked Example

Companion to `adr-format-and-templates.md` (ADR format, when to write, database/auth templates).

## Template: Service Extraction

```markdown
# ADR-NNN: Extract [Feature] into Separate Service

## Context

[Why now? What pain in the monolith? Be specific: deploy coupling, scaling bottleneck, team contention]

## Decision

Extract [feature] into a standalone service communicating via [HTTP / gRPC / events].

## Extraction Checklist

- [ ] Feature has clear bounded context (few shared data dependencies)
- [ ] Team can independently deploy and operate the service
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline exists for the new service
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Rollback plan defined
- [ ] Data migration plan (if splitting database)

## Boundary Definition

| Data/Entity | Stays in Monolith | Moves to New Service |
| ----------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Users       | X                 |                      |
| Orders      |                   | X                    |
| Payments    |                   | X                    |
| Products    | X                 |                      |

## Communication Pattern

| Interaction        | Pattern     | Why                        |
| ------------------ | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Create order       | Sync HTTP   | Caller needs confirmation  |
| Order shipped      | Async event | Notification, non-blocking |
| Get user for order | Sync HTTP   | Need data to process       |

## Alternatives Considered

### Keep in Monolith + Modularize

- Pros: No distributed system complexity, shared transactions
- Cons: Doesn't solve [specific pain point]

### Extract as Library

- Pros: Code reuse without network boundary
- Cons: Still coupled deployment
```

## Worked Example: ADR-001 Use PostgreSQL as Primary Database

```markdown
# ADR-001: Use PostgreSQL as Primary Database

**Status:** Accepted **Date:** 2026-01-15 **Deciders:** Backend team (3 engineers)

## Context

Building an e-commerce API for a B2B marketplace. Expected load: ~5K RPM initially, growing to ~50K RPM in 12 months. Data includes products, orders, users, and inventory. Team has strong SQL experience. Need full-text search for products and transactional consistency for orders.

## Decision

Use PostgreSQL 16 as the sole database. Use built-in tsvector for full-text search. Add Redis later only if measured latency exceeds targets.

## Alternatives Considered

### MongoDB

- Pros: Flexible product schemas, horizontal scaling
- Cons: Weaker transactions, no MongoDB experience, needs separate search solution
- Why rejected: Transaction safety for orders is critical. Product schema is actually structured. Team learning curve adds timeline risk.

### PostgreSQL + Elasticsearch

- Pros: Best-in-class search
- Cons: Two systems to maintain, data sync complexity
- Why rejected: PostgreSQL tsvector + GIN index handles requirements. ParadeDB is a drop-in upgrade without a separate system if needed.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Single database to operate, monitor, and backup
- ACID transactions for order processing
- Team productive immediately (familiar technology)
- Extension path: pgvector for recommendations, ParadeDB for advanced search

### Negative

- Horizontal scaling harder than MongoDB (not needed at 50K RPM)
- Schema changes require migrations (mitigated by golang-gin-psql-dba migration safety guide)

### Risks

- Unpredictable product schemas → mitigated by JSONB columns
- Full-text search outgrows tsvector → mitigated by ParadeDB upgrade path

## Follow-up Actions

- [x] Set up PostgreSQL 16 with Docker
- [x] Define initial schema
- [ ] Configure connection pooling
- [ ] Set up backup strategy
```
