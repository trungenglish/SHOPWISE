# Architecture Decision Records — Format and Templates

Lightweight templates for documenting architecture decisions. Store in `docs/adr/` in your project.

Companion to `adr-service-extraction-and-example.md` (service extraction template, worked example).

## ADR Format

```markdown
# ADR-NNN: [Short Decision Title]

**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD **Deciders:** [who was involved]

## Context

What is the problem? Why are we making this decision now? What forces are at play (technical, business, team)?

## Decision

What did we choose? State it clearly in one sentence, then elaborate.

## Alternatives Considered

### Option A: [Name]

- Pros: ...
- Cons: ...
- Why rejected: ...

## Consequences

- Positive: What gets better?
- Negative: What gets worse or harder?
- Risks: What could go wrong?

## Follow-up Actions

- [ ] Action items resulting from this decision
```

Rules: number sequentially (ADR-001, ADR-002, ...); never delete — mark as `Deprecated` or `Superseded by ADR-XXX`; keep short (1-2 pages); write ADRs for decisions, not implementations.

**When to write:** choosing between 2+ technologies; changing an established pattern; adding infrastructure; making an irreversible or expensive-to-reverse decision; decision affects multiple teams.

**Don't write for:** obvious choices, minor refactoring, bug fixes, style preferences.

ADR lifecycle: `Proposed → Accepted → [lives forever] → Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX`

## Template: Database Choice

```markdown
# ADR-NNN: Database Selection for [Feature/Service]

## Context

[Describe data requirements: volume, access patterns, consistency needs, team familiarity]

## Decision

Use [PostgreSQL / MongoDB / Redis / etc.] as the primary datastore for [scope].

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria          | Weight | Option A | Option B |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------- | -------- |
| Team familiarity  | High   | ...      | ...      |
| Query flexibility | Medium | ...      | ...      |
| Operational cost  | High   | ...      | ...      |

## Alternatives Considered

### PostgreSQL

- Pros: ACID, mature ecosystem, pgvector/PostGIS, team knows SQL

### MongoDB

- Pros: Flexible schema, easy horizontal scaling
- Cons: Eventual consistency by default, weaker joins

## Follow-up Actions

- [ ] Set up database infrastructure; define schema; configure connection pooling
```

## Template: Auth Strategy

```markdown
# ADR-NNN: Authentication and Authorization Strategy

## Context

[Who are the users? Internal/external? Mobile/web/API? Security requirements?]

## Decision

Use [JWT with refresh tokens / session cookies / OAuth2 + OIDC / API keys] for authentication. Use [RBAC / ABAC / simple role check] for authorization.

## Alternatives Considered

### JWT with Refresh Tokens

- Pros: Stateless verification, works across services, mobile-friendly
- Cons: Can't revoke individual tokens without a blocklist

### Session Cookies

- Pros: Simple, revocable, well-understood
- Cons: Requires session store (Redis), not ideal for mobile

### OAuth2 + External Provider

- Pros: Offload auth complexity, social login support
- Cons: Vendor dependency, more complex integration
```

## Template: Caching Layer

```markdown
# ADR-NNN: Caching Strategy for [Feature/System]

## Context

[What's slow? Read/write ratio? Current latency? Target latency? Freshness requirements?]

## Decision

Use [HTTP cache headers / in-memory cache / Redis] for [scope]. Cache TTL: [duration]. Invalidation strategy: [TTL / write-through / event-driven].

## Alternatives Considered

### No Cache (Optimize Queries) — Try this first

### In-Memory (ristretto) — < 100MB, single-instance

### Redis — > 100MB, multi-instance, need consistent cache
```

---

## Template: API Versioning

```markdown
# ADR-NNN: API Versioning Strategy

## Decision

Use URL path versioning (`/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`) with minimum 3-month deprecation notice for external consumers.

## Version Bumping Rules

| Change Type              | Version Bump? |
| ------------------------ | ------------- |
| Add response field       | No            |
| Remove response field    | Yes           |
| Change field type        | Yes           |
| Change pagination format | Yes           |
```
